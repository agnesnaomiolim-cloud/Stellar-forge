//! - [`wasm_mutator`] implements the MutatingAdmissionWebhook handler that
//!   intercepts StellarNode WASM deployment payloads and routes them through
//!   the wasm-opt bytecode optimizer sidecar before they are persisted to
//!   etcd.
//! - [`auth`] implements HashiCorp Vault authentication via the Kubernetes
//!   service account auth method (token exchange + in-memory token cache).
//! - [`vault_injector`] implements the MutatingAdmissionWebhook handler that
//!   intercepts Stellar Core pod creation and injects a Vault-backed seed
//!   init container plus a memory-only tmpfs volume carrying the generated
//!   `stellar-core.cfg` (issue #224).
